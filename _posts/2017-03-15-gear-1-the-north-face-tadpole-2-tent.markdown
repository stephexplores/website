# North Face Tadpole 2 Tent and Footprint

Our first trip out with this tent was in the middle of February. We spent a weekend at our friend’s cabin on West Hawk Lake and with the balmy winter temperatures we figured we may as well give winter camping a shot. Instead of snow we woke up to sleet and rain, signalling an early end to winter. 

While researching tents my main focus was looking for a small backpacking tent that we could bring to Iceland. The Tadpole 2 checked all of our boxes and ended up being the perfect fit for us. We took the tent on the Mantario Trail on May Long Weekend and were once again greeted with no-so-fortunate weather. As a result, we had a few rainy and wet nights to test out its durability. Unfortunately on this trip we forgot the pegs so we only had a couple borrowed pegs to secure the vestibule open. We were a little concerned that the side panels would soak through at night but we woke up warm and dry every morning!

The two person tent has a trail weight of 3 lbs 15 oz and costs around $430. Word on the street is that they’re no longer manufacturing the tent but you may still be able to pick it up in-store or online. I was able to snag a great deal on the Tadpole 2 footprint from the Prairie Summit Shop.

What I Loved:
•	Small footprint – capable of fitting in small isolated spots
•	Roomy enough for two regular sized sleeping pads as well as two bags inside the tent at the base of our feet
•	Weather proof – the tent held up in the snow/sleet and the rain
•	Pole construction – the hubbed poles connect to the tent using pull and secure gadgets, they felt very stable! 	

Critiques:
•	Only one vestibule - I usually prefer having access on both sides of the tent but the added benefit is an even smaller footprint
•	Set up was fussy at first, but we had things down pat by the second night


Overall this has been a great tent for us so far. I have no concerns about its ability to hold up in windy and wet Icelandic weather!
